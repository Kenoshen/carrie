		<h2>Classic Book Recover</h2>
		<p>Designed in Illustrator & Photoshop</p>
		<p>
			This project involved choosing a classic book to recover in a way it has never been shown
			before. The iconic images that show up for The Lord of The Flies are; a pigs head on a stick, a
			jungle, a wild boy and some sort of distorted color. I decided to take the symbolic image of a
			conch shell and have it grunged up by the flies pouring out of it. This image foreshadows the
			actual storyline of the book, that with structure and civilization is also disorder and savagery.
