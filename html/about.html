            As a kid, I always loved putting together magic shows and
            starting new lemonade selling companies. I would design flyers
            and posters to put up all over my neighborhood. I continued
            to explore my creative talents by taking my first graphic design
            class in high school and absolutely fell in love with web and
            graphic design.

            Continuing my education with a Bachelor of Science Degree, I
            am currently majoring in Web Design and Interactive Media with
            an emphasis in Graphic Design at Harding University. I thrive
            under the pressure of deadlines and continuously challenge
            myself with new goals and creating smarter designs.

            If I could describe myself in three words they would be,
            passionate (because I firmly believe if you love what you do you
            never work a day in your life), dedicated (because it is my goal
            to seek perfection in what I create) and creative (because I enjoy
            the challenge of bringing new ideas to life).
